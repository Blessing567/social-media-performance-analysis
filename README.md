# social-media-performance-analysis

## Project Background
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, brands and creators rely heavily on data to understand what drives engagement across social media platforms.
This project analyzes a 2024 dataset containing post-level metrics across TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X (Twitter) to uncover key insights into content performance, audience behavior, and regional engagement patterns.
The goal of this project is to help businesses and content strategists identify which platforms, content types, and publishing strategies yield the best results and how these vary across different regions of the world.
## About Dataset
The dataset consolidates information about various posts published across TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.com. It includes metadata such as post type (video, carousel, text), content category (product promotion, educational, entertainment), publishing times, and associated hashtags. It also tracks performance indicators like engagement, views, impressions, clicks, click-through rates, and post reach across countries and regions.

## Objectives
